OJS child theme for extending OJS's default theme with views of the geospatial metadata for the OPTIMETA Geoplugin, <https://github.com/TIBHannover/optimetaGeo>.

Based on <https://github.com/NateWr/defaultChild>.

**Issues are managed on the mein repository at TIBHannover/optimetaGeo.**

## Making your theme compatible

This theme is a child theme overriding seleted components of the OJS frontend that need to be extended for the OPTIMETE Geoplugin.
If your plugin overrides the same components, then the geoplugin might not behave correctly.
Therefore, please open an issue with the label `theme` by [clicking this link](https://github.com/TIBHannover/optimetaGeo/issues/new?labels=theme) if you want to add support for your template - we will help you!
